summary			"git integration scripts for Yabadabbadoo"
Description			"A small set of bash scripts that add git (esp. Github) integration to the Yabadabbadoo IDE. You will have to restart Yabadabbadoo to auto-detect this package. That will not be required if you installed it from the Yabadabbadoo menu itself.

Some scripts adapted for Haiku from scripts by rShetty, see https://github.com/rShetty/Scriptomaniac
